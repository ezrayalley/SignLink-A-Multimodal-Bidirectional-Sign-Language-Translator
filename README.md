# Real-Time Bidirectional Sign Language Translation Using Deep Learning and Computer Vision for Inclusive Communication

A cutting-edge Sign Language Translator designed to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and non-hearing communities.
This tool translates sign gestures into text and voice, and vice versa, enabling seamless communication.


## Features

- **Sign-to-Text Translation**: Converts sign language gestures into readable text.
- **Sign-to-Voice Translation**: Generates speech from recognized gestures.
- **Text/Voice-to-Sign Translation**: Converts written or spoken language into visual sign representations.
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Uses machine learning models for accurate and responsive translations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design suitable for all users.
- **Scalable Design**: Can be extended to support additional sign languages and gestures.
  

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time gesture detection and image processing.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Machine learning frameworks for gesture recognition.
- **Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech Libraries**: Enables voice-based functionalities.
